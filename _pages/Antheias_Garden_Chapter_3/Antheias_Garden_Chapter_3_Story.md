# Antheias Garden - Chapter 3

The pond did not leave her mind, there was something about it, she never
experienced herself. The lilies were bigger and more colorful than she expected
and there where almost too many fishes already in it. Did she put too much of
her own inner essence into this garden? Was it the soil? Was the sun different
here? The breeze from the sea not that far away? It would almost be a fishers
paradise here.

Should she adjust natures path slightly? But nature would balance itself, not?
This strange thoughts came up again, like with the petals some days ago. Are
there some hidden forces, beyond every goddess and god?

At the moment there were 200 rainbow trouts in the pond (initial population). It
was impossible that there were more than 400 rainbow trouts in the pond
(carrying capacity). There wouldn't enough insects anymore to feed all of the
fishes and not even enough space for the fishes itself. She also new that the
number of trouts were increasing in an exponential manner.

- Initial Population: 200 rainbow trouts
- Carrying Capacity: 400 rainbow trouts
- Exponential Growth Rate: 0.4

After how many days, would there be already more than 350 rainbow trouts in the
pond, if Antheias model is correct?
