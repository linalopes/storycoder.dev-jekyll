# Winter Calmness - Summer Madness

This quietness undeniably evokes this moment of profound calmness within, but at
the same time it fosters this sheer solitude, which seems irrevocably unbearable
at times. Walking down this dark alley, this abandoned alley, with only imagined
sunshine, brings pensiveness to the point as to which doubts arose whether going
on this journey alone, in the dawn of a deep winter night, was the right
decision. The masses of snow, covering all man-made architecture and urbanity,
promote this feeling of silence as the snow cushions the otherwise prevailing
loudness of old buses, car engines and fellow people. From the bench, looking at
the street, the feeling of this winter beauty is everything.

It is everything compared to when I think of the summer, when I ponder how many
people pass this daring street with loudness, with no calmness to think. In the
summer every three minutes a bus drives past, from noon on passing with two
passengers, and then carrying literally a dozen people more with every passing
quarter of an hour.

Worse are only the cars, with one car driving past each minute, only passing
with the driver and empty seats from noon on, except at every 6th minute where a
full car carrying five people passes.

The walkers are the least loudest, because in a time span of eleven minutes, a
soothing rhythm is observed from noon on, at which with every passing minute one
more walker passes, starting with one person, until the eleventh minute, at
which the cycle restarts.

A deep feeling of uneasiness awakens amid the calmness, thinking of how many
people pass this street from noon to 6 pm on a noisy summer day? Print the
result. From the bench, looking at the street, the feeling of this summer
madness is everything.
