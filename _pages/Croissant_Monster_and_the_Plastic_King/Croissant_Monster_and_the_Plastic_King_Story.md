# Croissant Monster and the Plastic King

Flour flying everywhere around us, it feels like it is snowing in the bakehouse.
And the way it smells; it reminds me of the pre-Christmas odors like ginger,
cinnamon, cloves and dry oranges.

But it is already January, more precisely 6th January, and we are celebrating
Twelfth Day. That is why we are baking our very own traditional big King Cake,
which consist of a wreath of 17 bread rolls. In only one of the bread rolls,
there is a white small plastic King. Whoever picks that bread roll, gets to wear
the cardboard crown and feel like a King or Queen. The croissant monster and me
hustle to bake the King Cake, while we are both squinting at the TV showing a
famous old school 70s quiz show. And while we are busy mixing flour, butter,
sugar and everything else, we both whish we would win the main prize of the quiz
show, which is a car, whereas the consolation prize is a goat. While I wish for
my favorite car, which is a mint green, pastel colored beetle, the croissant
monster hopes for a fairytale like gingerbread car to drive around the bakery
and breakfast room instead.

To my surprise, somebody just won the main price of a car in the retro TV show,
and I glanced at the TV screen in astonishment. The croissant monster of course
took the opportunity to place the plastic king in one of the bread rolls,
without me seeing which one.

After baking it, the croissant monster and me decided to play each other for the
mighty cardboard crown. I will win the crown if I know the answer to the
following question. If I wonâ€™t know the correct answer, the croissant monster
wins the crown. The croissant monster, who knows where the plastic king is
hidden, asks me to guess in which of the 17 bread rolls the king is hidden. When
I pick a bread roll, he takes away another bread roll without the king in it.
Next round, we do the same: I pick another bread roll (not the same as before),
and the croissant monster once again takes away another bread roll without the
king in it. And the rounds continue like this.

Question: How many rounds do have to pass for me to have at least a 50 % chance
to have the king in my picked bread roll, with the condition that I keep
switching between the remaining bread rolls?

Code wisely, so you will win the crown and can continue to watch the Quizz Show
as the newly crowned Queen or King. Take a Guess.

Non-Codable Questions: 1) The story contains (pop) cultural references to books
and TV shows, etc.; what are they?
