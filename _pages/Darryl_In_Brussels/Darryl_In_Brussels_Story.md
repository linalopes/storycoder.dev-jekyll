# Darryl in Brussels

Darryl, the donkey, used to be really famous, on social media, among his mates,
he was the star of his family basically. Everyone adored him, worshipped him in
extravagant spheres. He of course, went along with it, he proudly marched
through the fields, the city, the farms, people bowed at him, animals bowed at
him. Yes he was truly a hero for them.

But one day, out of nothing, he lost his ability to produce money in his
stomach! No coins ü™ô ever came out of him again. He started to feel sick, but
not because his belly stopped creating money, but because his previously adored
family and friends stopped caring about him, turned away from him.

Darryl felt lonely, and useless. He was strolling pensively along the trottwar,
as he stumbled upon an advertisement for an open source tech conference. Excited
by the prospect of learning more about technology, Darryl decided to embark on
an adventure to attend the conference.

The journey was long and tiring, but Darryl was determined to reach his goal. He
crossed many waffle shops, passed innumerable chocolate üç´ confiseries and
Belgian fries üçü shops; all sources of countless potential distractions on the
way to the open source conference. But he conquered them all, including the
tasty beer coming from a somewhat infantile appearing statue. On the way to the
conference, he started to feel excited, yes ecstatic, almost like in a delirium.
He started briefly hallucinating about amazing wall comics, graffities and
street art, but wait, these are real! What an amazing city! The Belgian
chocolate was hard to withstand; but when he was thinking about Swiss Chocolate,
he could resist the Belgian chocolate, too.

Stopping at the last waffle stand before the conference, he couldn‚Äôt resist, he
desperately wanted one. Since he doesn‚Äôt produce nor possess any money anymore
to buy a waffle, the waffle seller gave him another option:

# Codable Questions

If you help me solve the following problem, you can have a free waffle with any
toppings you like. Okay, here is the issue: In about an hour, 30 famous open
source programmers will be standing in line here for a waffle. I want to
decorate special waffles for them with their names on them: One name per waffle.
The names shall be written with fine Belgian chocolate letters that I bought. I
bought six sets of letters (each set has 26 letters of the English Alphabet). I
probably won‚Äôt have enough letters to write all their names.

After which person (Denis is the 1, Aaron the 2, ...) in the below
fixed line of programmers will I not be able to continue writing their names
anymore?

<div data-solution="5"></div>

After said person, if I'm allowed to skip people, how many names, still
following below order, can I still write?

<div data-solution="10"></div>

Line of programmers:

```
Dennis, Aaron, Donald, Tim, Bjarne, Linus, Guido, James, Richard, Brian, Grace,
Alan, Niklaus, Guy, Fabrice, Donald, Ken, John, Eric, Anders, Alexander,
Charles, Alan, Ronald, Andrew, Leslie, Edsger, John, Keith, Barbara

# The Conference

Darryll, the donkey, managed to solve the problem. After solving the problem and
many distractions on the way, Daryll has reached the conference venue. When he
finally arrived, he was awestruck by the sight of hundreds of people gathered to
learn and share their knowledge of technology.

Darryl was able to attend various talks and workshops, and he was amazed by the
wealth of information and the passion of the attendees. He also met many other
animals who shared his love for technology, and he was happy to make new
friends. At the end of the conference, Darryl was inspired to continue his
journey of learning. He left the conference with a newfound appreciation for
open-source technology and a desire to contribute to the community.

From that day on, Darryl was known as the tech-savvy donkey and was sought after
for his knowledge and expertise. He continued to attend tech events and spread
his love of technology to others, inspiring a new generation of
tech-enthusiasts. He may not produce money nor have his old, superficial friends
anymore, but he gained the love for technology and many new real friends, to
which he connected in an alternative, federated social network :-).

# Additional non-codable questions:

1) Can you guess the full names of the famous programmers?
2) What is the name of the conference that Darryl went to?
