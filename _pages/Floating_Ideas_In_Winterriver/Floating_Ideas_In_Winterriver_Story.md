# Floating Ideas in Winterriver

Once upon a time, in a dark alley 🌃, in Winterriver in the year 2017 ❄️🌊,
there was a StoryCoder 📝💻, unknown and anonymous, he was wondering through the
booths 🎪, scared and lonely, fascinated by all the new ideas 💡, and the love
of the participants 💙. Never in a million years would he have thought to one
day be glancing through his own ideas! In his mind nothing existed at first 🧠,
just this sheer admiration for the fact that out of a vision something
meaningful can emerge 👀, from the darkness a ray of sun light can shine through
☀️. The tech innovations, the food ideas, the everyday business improvements,
the environment initiatives, the health, education and state start ups: All hit
the StoryCoder with indescribable amazement 🎉. His eyes were glowing, it was
something like magic 🪄. Then he went home, grabbing one last bite of hot dog on
the way 🌭.

And years later, more than half a decade, he remembered the glow in his eyes, he
remembered the ideas, the joy, the creation, the beauty of news things 🚀. And a
story was born, which can be coded, in all coding languages you want 💻. And
StoryCoder was created. But he no longer walks alone. That night, he walked
along the river in winter, and there was a community 👥👥, that joined him, a
community that is open for everyone who wants to get into coding or writing
stories 🤗. He emerged from the darkness, and on the way to the Start Up night,
he saw thousands of new stunning ideas floating in the winter river ☄️.

In the hall he saw a magnitude of booths listed below 🛒. He was flabbergasted
once again. As he walked around he noticed all the names of the companies 🏬. He
realized that some letters in the company names seem to be more popular and
hence occur more frequently 🔤. And he was wondering which letters those would
be. Print the three letters that occur the most frequently and the three letters
that occur most rarely across all the company names listed below.

He further observed that the company booths all have a category, for example
health start up, tech start up, environment start up, etc 📊. However, the
booths do not stand next to each other in their respective categories 🔀. So the
StoryCoder decides to make a new list of where the booths should stand,
regrouping all the companies so that they are grouped within their category.
Print this list.

And the night goes on. And as the StoryCoder goes forward, putting on playful
socks from the goodie bag 🧦, he will never forget. Where. His. Inspiration.
Came. From. Thank you Start Up Night Winterriver ❄️🌊!

Take a Guess. Non-Codable Questions:

1. Guess which three letters occur the most and the least frequently before coding it!
2. Guess which category has the most companies.
