# This section shows that a person can write a story without a code to solve in it; just a normal story without a riddle in it. Later, another person can implement a new paragraph into the story where there IS a code to solve in it. A third person can then write the code solutions in any programming language possible.
# Example How To Implement Code Winter Beauty

The version 1 of the story below contains no code to solve yet. This is why it
is located here in the folder â€˜AAA_Stories_Without_Implemented_Code_Yet. This
folder is used for coders to implement some coding into the story. How is this
done?

The version 2 of the story below shows, for example, how a coding problem can be
implemented.

## Version 1: Without code

This quietness undeniably evokes this moment of profound calmness within, but at
the same time it fosters this sheer solitude, which seems irrevocably unbearable
at times. Walking down this dark alley, this abandoned alley, with only imagined
sunshine, brings pensiveness to the point as to which doubts arose whether going
on this journey alone, in the dawn of a deep winter night, was the right
decision. The masses of snow, covering all man-made architecture and urbanity,
promote this feeling of silence as the snow cushions the otherwise prevailing
loudness of old buses, car engines and fellow people. From the bench, looking at
the street, the feeling of this winter beauty is everything.

## Version 2: With implemented code in the second paragraph

This quietness undeniably evokes this moment of profound calmness within, but at
the same time it fosters this sheer solitude, which seems irrevocably unbearable
at times. Walking down this dark alley, this abandoned alley, with only imagined
sunshine, brings pensiveness to the point as to which doubts arose whether going
on this journey alone, in the dawn of a deep winter night, was the right
decision. The masses of snow, covering all man-made architecture and urbanity,
promote this feeling of silence as the snow cushions the otherwise prevailing
loudness of old buses, car engines and fellow people. From the bench, looking at
the street, the feeling of this winter beauty is everything.

It is everything compared to when I think of the summer, when I ponder how many
people pass this daring street with loudness, with no calmness to think. In the
summer every three minutes a bus drives past, at noon passing with two
passengers, and then carrying literally a dozen people more with every passing
quarter of an hour. Worse are only the cars, almost only driving with one driver
and empty seats, except at every 6th minute where a full car carrying five
people passes. The walkers are the least loudest, because in a time span of
eleven minutes, a soothing rhythm is observed, at which with every passing
minute one more walker passes until the eleventh minute, at which the cycle
restarts. A deep feeling of uneasiness awakens amid the calmness, thinking of
how many people pass this street from noon to 6 pm on a noisy summer day? Print
the result. From the bench, looking at the street, the feeling of this summer
madness is everything.
