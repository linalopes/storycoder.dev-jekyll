# Ride Right beside them

It looked unforgettably mind-blowing from above, like a geometrically
consistent, yet artfully beautiful picture. One that you would like to look at,
hanging solemnly in your living room area, one that you can stare at forever,
constantly finding endless details of this memorable city. Sometimes, glancing
at it for too long, it seems mesmerizing, with their ever-riding objects,
portraying bicycles, moving in a delightfully rhythmical, yet totally
undisturbing way. It evokes some kind of inner stability, pondering at the
masses of bicycles all following a wonderfully marked track. The colors strike
as amazing, as all of the riders are exemplarily wearing colorful helmets to
prevent dangerous accidents. It feels like theyâ€™re riding marvelously forever,
and forever somehow evokes security. But forever is not always forever, as
suddenly, one group of riders seems to split from the main group, causing the
fascinating chain to break abruptly. The picture has quickly changed. Theyâ€™re
riding somewhere, but where are they heading to? It appears theyâ€™re lost in
cyclation! While unconsciously distancing themselves from the main riders, the
lost riders are determined to find their way back again: They wish to ride right
beside them, in order to catch up to preserve the beauty of the picture. They
wonder if only there was an app to show them the cycle path next time ðŸ˜‰?

The lost group rides along the following streets listed below in that order. In
this magic city, the distance between one street and the next street is
calculated by adding the values of the letters that the street names hold. Every
letter holds the values below. Print how many kilometers the lost group rides.

While approaching, a man is screaming all street names in said order, however,
the lost group can only hear every second letter of the street names. Print
which letters the lost group hears.

Non-Codable question: What are the (pop culture) references in the story?
