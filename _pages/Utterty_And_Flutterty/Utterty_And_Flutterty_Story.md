# Utterty and Flutterty 🦋♥️🦋

On a perfect summer evening, flying around as if love never ends, dreaming
beyond as if love never sleeps and fluttering around as if love never lands,
there is Butterfly Utterty 🦋. Being so in love and nervous 💘, he nearly
forgets to put on his newly purchased rose-tinted glasses 🤓 to go out today .
He’s having so many butterflies in his stomach, even though he is a butterfly
himself 😂😂😂. Of course some wonder, if that’s even possible 🧐😂. He’s flying
around and from far far away, in his rose-coloured sky, there comes flying
Butterfly Flutterty 🦋. He of course asks her for a date ♥️ to play dart 🎯
together. Flutterty, however, agrees only upon certain conditions: If Utterty
can list the first four lines of her most favorite Shakespeare sonnet ever,
which is sonnet 116, with only listing every second letter in less than 30 sec;
Flutterty will meet on Monday already; if he takes more than 30 sec she will
meet on Tuesday, if he lists the lines with every letter instead of every second
letter she will meet on Wednesday; otherwise she’s not interested in dating
Utterty 🥲! Utterty of course is flabbergasted, but quickly thinks of all
possible outcomes. Print all of them.

Shakespeare, Sonnet 116

```
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.
```
