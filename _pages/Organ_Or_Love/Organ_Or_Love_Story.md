# Organ or Love?

With a perl necklace in my left hand and a bag full of thoughts I was watching
outside the window at the rainy late afternoon. It gave me this idea ðŸ’¡; this
high; it was like an addiction; it messed with my head, with my heart, with my
soul; it made me crave! And I kept on to the perl necklace.Was it just a neuron
thing? Was it just adrenaline? Was it just an organ? Was it just a fantasy?

And as I was pressing the necklace stronger, I was thinking: Was it love! Was it
only pain disguised in beauty? Was it an error? What was it? This is confusing
me, not knowing what it was! Iâ€™m feeling cringe now! Release me! I canâ€™t shake
it off just yet!

And I started counting the different types of pearls of the necklace in a row:
15 pearls of love, 17 pearls of trust, 14 pearls of joy, 19 pearls of feelings,
11 pearls of hope, 9 pearls of romance, 16 pearls of strength!

And then there was this moment of thunder in the rain, and out of nothing, a
strike shook me, my hand startled and let go of the necklace. And the pearls
fell. Hard on the ground. And split. Into many peaces. And changed shapes. Into
platonic solids. Just like broken glass. I felt them breaking:

- Every 7th pearl changed into a dodecahedron (12 faces)
- Every 8th pearl into a icosahedron (20 faces)
- Every 9th pearl into an octahedron (8 faces)
- Except for the 56th, 63th and 72th pearl which turns into a tetrahedron (4 faces)
- The rest of the pearls change into cubes (6 faces)

See documentation below: Make a list of the types of pearls and their respective
amount of faces. Print: Which type of pearl has the most, the least and the
median amount of faces (median = in this story, the fourth element in the list)
and how many faces do they have respectively?

And I finally felt release. It set me free. All the pearls changed into
beautiful shapes. Take a guess.

Non-Codable Questions: Guess, before coding: Which type of pearls has the median
amount of faces?

Type of Pearls:

- 1 till 15 = Pearls of Love
- 16 till 32 = Pearls of Trust

Changes of Pearl shapes:

- every 7th pearl into a dodecahedron (12 faces)

- every 9th pearl into an octahedron (8 faces)
- except for the 56th, 63th and 72th pearl which turn into a tetrahedron (4 faces)
- The rest of the pearls change into cubes (6 faces)

Make a list of all the types of pearls and sort them according to their respective amounts of faces from lowest to highest:

- Pearls of Love = ? faces
- Pearls of Trust = ? faces
- Pearls of Joy = ? faces
- Pearls of Feelings = ? faces
- Pearls of Hope = ? faces
