# Purloined Algorithm

You are a detective.

There was a missing algorithm that scientists need in order to cure aging. But
suddenly one day, the scientist that invented this algorithm disappeared. And
the only other person who knew about the algorithm was the assistant, Greg. The
police searched everywhere for it.

Here is a list of the places they searched:

- in his cloud accounts
- on his personal computer
- hacked his e-mail
- ran analysis and confiscated all of his USB sticks.
- read through his notes, and text messages
- Behind the wallpaper
- Under the carpets
- Inside the tables and chairs (using magnifying glasses)
- Inside the cushions (using needles)

You talk to Greg and he seemed to be a very intelligent person. You asked him
what are his interests outside of science and he responded, “scary stories.”

From this answer, you knew exactly where to find the missing formula.

Greg’s apartment was a 20 m^2 one room studio. There was an office corner with a
desk and a laptop, the kitchen with marble top with cookbooks and fresh
ingredients and the bathroom with porcelain. Using these clues, show how you
were able to narrow your search to 0.5 sq meter of the apartment.
