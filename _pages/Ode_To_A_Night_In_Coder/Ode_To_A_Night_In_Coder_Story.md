# Ode to a Night In Coder

During the dark, freezing evening of that February night in, all I could hear
was the church bell ringing and all I could think of was you. Was it me longing
for you? Maybe I have to do something I’ve never done before, maybe coding,
maybe writing stories, maybe both together, maybe storycoding. On the night you
left, from dusk at 8.43 pm till dawn at 5.49 am I kept on thinking of you. How
empty you were; how much full of love I mistakenly imagined you. You seemed like
magic to me, with your blue eyes appearing deeper than the ocean’s ever-deep
ground. How I have perceived you! Mr. Gray already told us not to get fooled by
outer looks, they must be deceiving. And yet we did; how foolish to admit our
own impediments; makes us more of a being. I used to think of you as often as
the church bell rang that night, and it rang a lot: Every full hour it rang as
often as the hour was. And every 15 min it indicated what quarter of an hour it
was by ringing once, twice or three times. How often I thought of you I could
never really tell nor truly know, except if I coded it. Print how many times I
thought of you. Unimaginable today that I thought of you so much.

When the last chime rang, it felt like something was over, and something has
started. It used to take us some time to do the things we never had, until we
started coding, and writing stories, and storycoder is born. Ode to a night in
coder!
