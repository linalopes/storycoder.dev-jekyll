# Antheias Garden - Chapter 4

Would it be possible for her to ask Athena for some wisdom? There something
simpler she could try first. She knew that in Mykene there was a library,
supposedly full of wisdom from the gods, written down by fallible humans.

Countless hours she read, from first dusk till dawn. One realization she made
quite early, that her model was too simplistic. The lilies in the pond were
attracting insects and the insects themselves where prey for the rainbow trouts.
Despite this lingering feeling, that she quite likely never fully would
understand how the laws of nature work or which goddess or even titan was behind
all of this, she still was happy about her better approach:

- 50% of the pond are filled with lilies about 500. and they triple every day.
- There are 200 (20% full) hungry insects and each eat 1 lily pad a day. They
  grow at a rate of 4 per day. They nibble all the time.
- The 4 rainbow trouts (1% full) of them will each eat 1 insect every day. They
  grow every day at a rate of 5 per day.

All of them cannot grow more than what they eat and when they get close, their
rate decreases proportional to how close they are. How many water lilies will
Antheia see when she returns on the next full-moon ðŸŒ•? How many insects and
rainbow trouts?
