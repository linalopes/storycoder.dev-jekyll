# Cruel Teacher 🧙‍♀️🧹📝

On a beautiful Friday morning the teacher happily gets her daily latte, the sun
shines through her witch like gray hair 🧙‍♀️, and she carries her beloved
morning news 📰 paper called ‘cruel teaching methods’. Happy 😊 she is, because
today is exam day 🗒️, where she soothingly sits in the old wooden chair,
sipping coffee ☕️ and reading in an undisturbed way while students sweat through
her unconquerable exam. To make sure her morning passes as quietly as planned
for her, she enforces strict methods.

With her favorite number being 7, with every passing minute that students come
late to her computer science exam 💻, they have to increasingly pay a penalty of
$7 💸. Ten of her students are late while dropping in one minute after the other
minute right after the regular start. The teacher is furious, her hair stands
up, with her beloved coffee time being constantly interrupted.

However, she takes comfort in earning money! Print how much money she will have
earned in the end!
