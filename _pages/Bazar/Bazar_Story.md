# Bazar

The sun 🌞, shining very brightly on the sellers tents ⛺, shows no mercy in the
midday heat of the day. And still, the glow of the traditional market, with the
ever-smelling freshly picked local fruits 🍎🍍🍈 and vegetables 🌶️🥗
overshadows the notion of the nearly insufferable heat.

At this famous ‘all costs 10 \$’ bazar Saturday morning, the seller
unfortunately fails at selling three types of goods 5 minutes before the bazar
closes:

- Pink stuffed elephants 🐘
- bright sun flowers 🌻
- and unstable cardboard bicycles 🚲

This is why he quickly got the idea to change the prices of the goods, however,
not all in favour of the buyer.

- The pink stuffed elephants’ prices increase by 3 \$
- the bright sun flowers decrease by 5 \$
- and the cardboard bicycles cost 2 \$ more than the pink stuffed elephants in
  the end

A buyer comes by and buys one item each. Has the bazar seller gained or lost
money by changing the prices compared to not changing the money? And how much
money has he gained 🤗 or lost 😔?

The answer should have one of the following forms, depending if the bazar seller
gained or lost money:

- `Gained 4$`
- `Lost 9$`
