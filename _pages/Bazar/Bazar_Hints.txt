Universal Hint System - Bazar

1. All three goods at the bazar each cost 10 dollars. Make an integer each for the elephant, the bicycle and the sunflower and set it to 10.
2. Now we need to calculate the sum of the initial price assuming that one item each is sold: Set the initial price by summing up the elephant, the bicycle and the sunflower.
3. The seller now changes the prices in this order: Increment the elephant by 3. Decrement the sunflower by 5. Set the bicycle to (elephant + 2)
4. Now it is time to calculate the sum of the new, changed, final prices, assuming that one item each is sold: Set the final price by summing up the elephant, the bicycle and the sunflower
5. At this stage we need to find out whether the seller has gained or lost money by changing the prices: Substract the initial price from the final price. 
6. Now write an if-clause: 
- If this difference is a positive number (greater than 0), then print that the seller has gained said mount of mone (difference).
- If this difference is a negative number (lower that 0), then print that the seller has lost said mount of money (difference). 
Decide: Was the idea to change the prices smart or not for the seller?
