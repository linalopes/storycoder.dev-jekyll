# Thanks Veggies Day

Characters of the Scene:

Princess Salad, Lady Purple, Madame Pumpkin, Mister Onion, Knight Tomato, Lord
Turkey, Count Leek, Mister Carrot, Sir Potato

Once upon a kitchen table, there were veggies vegging out. There was this
beautiful Princess Salad, and as she rolled out her marvelous light greenish
saladly dress, Mister Onion walked by. He couldn’t help himself but grinning at
Knight Tomato, who was also strolling along while still fixing his green looking
messy hair with a comb. He wanted to look chic and fancy tonight; most likely
wanting to impress Princess Salad. What a beautiful, late autumn day it was, and
a very special day indeed. Today all the homely vegetables would meet and in
their imagination, would eat, listen to music and dance with each other until
the early hours of the morning with a very special participant, Lord Turkey. As
a matter of fact, today, they can even choose to cook their own menu!

At one point Lady Purple, the proud eggplant, who would never ever stumble,
clumsily stumbled over a disorderly and sleepy Count Leek. He shortly thereafter
unapologetically showed his annoyance at being woken up by a rather peacockishly
flouncing Eggplant.

“Sush”, we heard a rather stressed feeling Lord Turkey wheezing: “Guys, what are
you all doing? We are totally late. Let’s plan dinner, otherwise we’ll be stuck
eating Mister Carrot’s usually ordered deep fried lasagne! Or even worse, Sir
Patato’s pebble stone casserole! so let’s move!”. Everybody agreed
full-throatedly: „Oh no, we don’t want to eat those things, let’s start cooking
food“.

Shorty after Madame Pumpkin arrived, who is usually always late (as she still
has to serve as carriage transporting other princesses), all veggies, and Lord
Turkey agree in unison to start stuffing Mister Turkey. Each veggie breaks
itself into little pieces and those pieces should theoretically enter the Turkey
one piece after the other in the following order within three rounds. However,
the veggies get jealous of each other and start disobeying this rule by entering
the Turkey more often. This makes Lord Turkey furious of course, because he is
stuffed too much and is going to explode soon. Confusion arises. Instead of
entering the Turkey piece after piece for three rounds, each veggie piece enters
with one more piece than the previous veggie. And after each round, the veggies
change order (see new order in the documentation below). Print the following
amounts: How many pieces of each veggie should have entered the Turkey in theory
and how many pieces of each veggie actually did enter the Turkey? Make a list,
starting with the lowest to the highest amounts.

In the end, despite Lord Turkey being full, the party continued inside and
everybody was enjoying themselves at Thanks Veggies Day.

Take a Guess. Non-Codable Questions:

1) Guess, before coding: Which veggie has the most pieces inside the turkey in the end?
