# Backpack Heist

The notorious businessman, Alexander Blackheart, murdered a member of the tribe,
Mr. Body, and hidden all the evidence in his luxurious mansion. The tribe rogue,
named Shadow, was determined to bring Blackheart to justice and set out to steal
the most valuable pieces of evidence. With a limited carrying capacity of only
12 pounds, Shadow had to choose wisely.

As Shadow entered the mansion, the hairs on the back of her neck stood up. She
knew that time was of the essence and quickly set to work searching for the
evidence. Shadow found the murder weapon, a heavy object weighing 7 pounds and
having a value of 0.8. While searching through Blackheart's study, Shadow
stumbled upon a diary, weighing 4 pounds and having a value of 0.9. In the
living room, Shadow discovered CCTV footage, weighing 5 pounds and having a
value of 0.7.

Shadow continued her search and found blood-stained clothing and linens,
weighing 6 pounds and having a value of 0.8. She also found a laptop, weighing 3
pounds and having a value of 0.6. As Shadow turned to leave, she heard a loud
squawk and looked up to see a parrot perched on a nearby shelf. Shadow shrugged
her shoulders, and moved on.

Shadow had to make a crucial decision. As she considered the items laying in
front of her, the parrot suddenly squawked, "Tama! Aaaaaah!" Shadow was taken
aback by the parrot's sudden outburst and recognized the name Tama, one of the
tribe council members. She also realized that the parrot had imitated the scream
of Mr. Body. Very intriguing. Shadow realized the parrot was indeed evidence for
the murder, and gave it a value of 0.6. The parrot weighed 2 lbs.

Which items should Shadow bring back with her? Justice for the tribe depends on
you!

The items are:

- Weapon
- CCTV
- Clothing
- Laptop
- Parrot

For the solution, sort the items by weight (heaviest first) and concatenate the
names of the items into one string.

<div data-solution="ClothingWeaponParrot"></div>

Hints:

- While all the weight are given in pounds, it doesn't matter for this riddle
