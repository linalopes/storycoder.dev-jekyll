# Across The Ocean

## Chapter 1 - The Secret Sea Meadow 🌿

This is the story, about Xayah, Yago and Zuri. Xayah was adventurous orca girl,
Yago a lovely octopus 🐙 boy and Zuri an inspiring jellyfish hermaphrodite. They
were all young, and the best friends 💕 one could have.

Xayah, Yago and Zuri had many other friends, some older, much older, some
younger, but many of them shared something uncommon in the sea world 🌊.

Xayah, Yago and Zuri had a deep emotional connection to each other. If Xayah
showed some courage, all of them felt invincible. If Yago was sad, Xayah and
Zuri also felt sad. And if Zuri came up with an amazing idea, all of them where
bubbling with new plans.

Their friends had other uncommon attributes. Some groups read each others mind
🧠, some could smell 👃 each other miles away and a few could hear 👂 each other
from the other side of the planet 🌏, ... but their stories will be told in
other chapters.

Despite that Xayah, Yago and Zuri were best friends, it was still not easy for
them. Their parents expected, that orcas, octopuses and jellyfishes all should
only care about each other. Orcas should only play with orcas, octopuses should
only learn from other octopuses and jellyfishes should stay within the family
all the time.

What Xayah, Yago and Zuri did, was almost expected. They met at their secret 🤐
place far away from everyone else, as often as possible. Reaching their secret
place was not a task for the faint-hearted:

1. an almost impenetrable maze of twining plants 🌱. Xayah
took the lead on this. It took them 165 seconds, to get through the maze.
2. a tricky lair with lots of sharp rocks 🪨. Yago could always
remember all the dangerous spots, it took them 41 seconds to get through the
lair.
3. a landscape full of black and white smokers 🌋, some of them
which had to be avoided at all cost. Zuri was leading and it took them another
223 seconds.

How many seconds did it take Xayah, Yago and Zuri to meet at their secret sea
meadow?

How many minutes, rounded up?

Hints

1. Use the plus operator (+) to add the three seconds
2. A minute consists of 60 seconds
3. Rounding up can often be done with a ceil function from a math library

## Chapter 2 - God Rays Upon the Seabed

Xayah, Yago and Zuri together reached their secret place. It was amazingly
beautiful. Sea grass waving with the flow of water. Many fishes 🐟, crabs 🦀,
slugs 🐌, starfishes, ... all with with unimaginable colors 🌈, all dancing 🕺💃
with the current. The sun 🌞 shining some rays through the water surface. It was
Zuri who almost immediately felt in trance, couldn't barely move out of joy 😂.
Not shortly after that, even bubbly Xayah was silent and just was
happy in the moment. The sun was heating up the water. It felt like in bathtub
🛁, a feeling anyone and everyone wished would just never stop.

After some time, Xayah, Yago and Zuri realized that if they listened carefully,
that in fact, there was a concert 🎶 ongoing. The fishes 🐟 were singing 🎤,
each of them just repeating a single letter 🔤. Was this true, it was a song
they made up for the 3 friends? The 1. 4. 7. and so on fish sung something for
Xayah. The 2. 5. 8. and so on fish sung something for Yago and the 3. 6. 9. and
so on fish sung something for Zuri. That this together still sounded soothing,
seemed to be an art 🎭 on its own. Did they ask 🙋 some questions?

## Chapter 3 - Cicis Friends

Yago, the octopus 🐙 answered first: I don't know why, but they're all very
helpful. I can cook 🍳 much more sophisticated meals 🍜, climbing 🧗 up
everywhere, but most important I can caress about nine of you at the same time.

Zuri, the jellyfish answered: I also don't know why, but I can assure you I win
in "Hide and Seek" all the time. At least as long as it is not dark under water,
they laughed. Whenever the sun goes down, I sometimes start to glow 🌟 in
different colors.

The enjoyment reflected also on Xayahs the orca. She answered: I am proud of my
whitest white and my darkest black. I look beautiful, is this not enough? When
you look closely I have purple line along my belly. This is me.

All the fish swum in unison, again the orchestra, but without a conductor.

The tiniest of all fishes 🐟, Cici, opened the mouth. Zuri, Yago, Xayah, we have
also a story to tell, but we need to know something first:

How long does it take you to swim 🏊 around the planet 🌏?

You mean if she would swim along the equator, the whole 40'000 km? Xayah asked?

Cici nodded.

Zuri said: Xayah is, fins down, our fastest swimmer, she can swim up to 50
kilometers per hour, and if she rides some waves 🌊, she can reach up to 100
kilometers per hour.

Yago said: Yes Zuri is right. I have to clam myself to Xayah, or else she is
just off and away. But I can propel 🚀 myself with almost 40 kilometers per
hour. Zuri can swim up to 10 kilometers per hour.

How many hours does Xayah have to swim around earth, without riding waves and
without taking any break?

<div data-solution="800"></div>

How many days, rounded up?

<div data-solution="34"></div>

How many days would Yago have?

<div data-solution="42"></div>

How many days would Zuri have?

<div data-solution="167"></div>

Hints

1. The, way how to solve this, is almost the same as in chapter 1.
2. Take the speed from Xayah without any waves.
3. A day has 24 hours.
